### Howdy, I'm Nick :wave: :man_technologist:

I’m a software engineer building modern, cloud native web applications. I also like to wear many hats. Depending on the day that could mean designing UI/UX prototypes in Figma, making SVG art, writing SQL triggers, soldering/tinkering with IoT devices, developing virtual reality in Unity 3d, debugging low-level code with gdb, or training a reinforcement learning agent.

My current wheelhouse looks something like this:
- *JavaScript*, *NodeJS/React/Redux/Express*, *Python*, *SQL*, *AWS*, *Netlify*

and I'm working to add *Ruby on Rails*, *Heroku*, *Kubernetes*, and *Docker* to that list.

------------

Right now, some of the topics I find most interesting include:

- De-google-ing (see [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), a (still relatively new) open-source alternative to Google Analytics)
- Camouflage from computer vision (see an interesting project by artist Adam Harvey [here](https://ahprojects.com/cvdazzle/))
- Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality art (see [Festival of the Impossible](https://www.festivaloftheimpossible.com/))
- The effect of data permanence, big data after death, digital heirlooms, digital/virtual memorials, and "digital wills"

Outside of tech, I like to spend a lot of time outside—I enjoy riding bikes, whitewater kayaking, rafting, and backpacking. I'm an amateur pianist, guitar picker, dungeon master, tennis player, basketballer, and furniture refurbisher. I like themed bathrooms, dogs who look like their owners, and throwing pasta against the wall to see if it's done.

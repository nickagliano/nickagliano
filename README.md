### Howdy, I'm Nick :wave: :man_technologist:

I’m a software engineer currently working mostly on cloud native web applications. I like to wear many hats——whether that means designing UI/UX prototypes in Figma, making SVG art, writing SQL triggers, soldering/tinkering with IoT devices, developing virtual reality in Unity 3d, debugging low-level code with gdb, or training a reinforcement learning agent.

My wheelhouse looks something like this:
- JavaScript, NodeJS/React/Redux/Express, Python, SQL, AWS, Netlify

I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails, Heroku, Kubernetes, and Docker.

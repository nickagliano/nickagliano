### Howdy, I'm Nick :kissing: :notes: :notes:

Iâ€™m a software engineer, right now mostly building cloud-native web applications.

------------

Right now, some of the topics I find most interesting include:

- De-google-ing (see [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), a (still relatively new) open-source alternative to Google Analytics)
- Camouflage from computer vision (see an interesting project by artist Adam Harvey [here](https://ahprojects.com/cvdazzle/))
- Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality art (see [Festival of the Impossible](https://www.festivaloftheimpossible.com/))
- The effect of data permanence, big data after death, digital heirlooms, digital/virtual memorials, and "digital wills"
- Serialized novels (self-publishing, releasing chapters at a time through subscription services)

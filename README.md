### Howdy, I'm Nick :kissing: :notes: :notes:

Iâ€™m a software engineer, right now mostly building cloud-native web applications. I enjoy messing around in the data science, ML, and AI fields, playing music and learning music theory. And sometimes I enjoy writing about things I find interesting or care about. 

------------

Right now, some of the topics I find most interesting include:

- Cryptocurrency 
  - Ethereum, [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/)
- [Nx, aka Numerical Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/nx#readme) (I also just love Elixir)
- De-google-ing (see [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), a (still relatively new) open-source alternative to Google Analytics)
- Camouflage from computer vision (see an interesting project by artist Adam Harvey [here](https://ahprojects.com/cvdazzle/))
- Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality art (see [Festival of the Impossible](https://www.festivaloftheimpossible.com/))
- The effect of data permanence, big data after death, digital heirlooms, digital/virtual memorials, and "digital wills"
